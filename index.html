<p>This is a 3D game made using Unity and C#. This was a solo, 2 week long project. </p>  
<li><a href="https://linej.itch.io/1986-zelda-first-dungeon">The Legend of Zelda (Unity Remaster)</a></li>
<p>This project is a recreation of the 1986 Zelda game, but with the addition of a new custom mechanic, an ice bomb. In this project I handled the room transitions and bladetrap enemies, as well as implementing the collectibles and inventory system. I also implemented the freezing component of the ice bomb. </p>
